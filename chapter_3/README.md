## EEE-201 Chapter 3

Let's complete our project by learning how to control our servos manually through the use of a joystick; we'll look at how to use arrays to make our motion more smooth.  Finally, we'll be putting on laser diode on the servos and controlling it through various means.

## Part 1 - 2-axis joystick

We begin by first getting the joystick working; hook it up as shown in the diagram below:


Load the sketch named joystick.ino onto your arduino and then open up the serial monitor. You should see the values on it change as you push the joystick around.
