## EEE-201 Chapter 2

Now that we know what sort of signal a servo requires in order to be controlled, let's learn how to do that with an Arduino.  We'll also be looking into how to make this process a lot easier through the use of the Servo library; and we'll be diving into more programming by learning several new control structures.
